The future of health and fitness is here. This food-tracking app is designed for individuals following a carnivore diet. It assists users in creating realistic weekly and monthly budgets based on their meat selections from grocery stores like Costco, Trader Joe's, and other local markets. The app is developed using TypeScript and React for the front end, with Express.js and Node.js on the server side, and it is hosted on AWS for public usage.
